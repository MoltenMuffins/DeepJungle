Deep Learning workflow abstraction for tf.keras projects

Having participated in Shopee's National Data Science Challenge 2019, I felt that my team spent significant effort trying to implement the *hows* of model building rather than the *whys*. In the chase for accuracy, we worked on different model architectures with messy data pipelines which made it hard for us implement our models together as an ensemble model. This limited our competitive ability and I felt that we could have utilized our time better had there been a better framework (or a framework at all) in place.

My intension is for this repo to provide modular implementation of common data exploratory analysis, pre-processing steps, pipelining, model building and evaluation steps for future Deep Learning hackathons where the focus is more on implementation than rigour.
